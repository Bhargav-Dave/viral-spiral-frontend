        Welcome to VIRAL SPIRAL, a game about sharing news on the internet. In
        this game you will play a member of a closed online community â€” think of
        it as a group chat.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In your turn, you will pick up a card reflecting a NEWS HEADLINE which
        you can then share with any of your fellow players, or keep for
        yourself. Sharing a card will earn you ONE POINT. And if someone
        reshares your card, you will receive ANOTHER POINT.

      <Paragraph>The first player to 15 points WINS. Easy, right? </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This game is based in a fictional city called CITY. In City, there are
        various communities distinguished by the colour of their shirts. They
        are the redshirts and the blueshirts. [5P EDIT: They are the redshirts,
        blueshirts and yellowshirts.]{" "}
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        If you share negative news against either of these communities, it will
        increase your PERSONAL BIAS and the GLOBAL BIAS.{" "}
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        All the residents of City feel very strongly about a few topics, like
        socks or cats. Sharing positive or negative news about any of these
        topics will increase or decrease your AFFINITY for this topic.{" "}

      <Paragraph>
        The greater your affinity, the more interesting POWERS you get to
        unlock.

      <Paragraph>
        The greater your bias, the more INSIDIOUS/DANGEROUS/POLARISED the world
        becomes.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Be careful! When GLOBAL BIAS hits 15, the game comes to an end, and
        everybody loses. And nobody wants that.{" "}
